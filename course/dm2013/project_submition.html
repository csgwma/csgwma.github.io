<h3>Project Submittion</h3>
<li><strong>About the programming tasks:</strong></li>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Your code will be checked with JPlag. Write the code with your own hand. Don't copy others' code or the previous implemented.  Don't share your code with others either.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, once found plagiarism with your code, your grades will be heavily penalized. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Since the goal of this part is to test your understanding and mastering of basic data mining techniques, simply submitting source code with a ReadMe document or short slide containing directions of how it works is OK.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Following the conventions of software development, for example, employing unit test frameworks, adequate code comments, splitting source code files and documents in different folders is encouraged.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Due:</strong> 2014.1.18  12 o'clock pm 
<br><br>
<li><strong>About the final project:</strong></li><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  This work has two milestones, the proposal and report.<br><br>
<!--  You should submit your proposal with the same deadline as programming task, while the report's submission  is not so urgent.<br><br>-->
   Initial proposal:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  The proposal(1-2 paragraph of description of your project) should include your project title and delineate<br>
      <ol>
      <li> related work</li>
      <li>  main idea</li>
      <li>  why choose such an idea</li> 
      <li> key algorithms and expectation</li>
      </ol>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Proposal due:</strong>  2014.2.23  12 o'clock pm<br>
    
    <br><br>
    
     Final Project writeup:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; The project report should include a technical report (10-20 pages with font size of 10 point or little four) and a slide which presents your work concisely. We will alas check your code by JPlag.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  The project writeup should include the following:<br>
        <ol>
       <li> your specific implementation details, such as your evaluation metric and validation method.</li>
       <li> key results and critical discoveries. Using tables, pictures, figures et al. is encouraged.</li>
       <li> what implementation worked and what did not work, and give your own explanation for them</li>
       <li> self-evaluation</li>
       </ol>
       
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Report due:</strong> 2014.2.23  12 o'clock pm<br>

<h4>To Submit:</h4>
    ftp://202.38.75.5<br>
    username: upload<br>
    passwd: dm2013<br>
    
    <p> There are two folders in the ftp root directory, namely <i>FinalProject</i> and <i>ProgramAssigments</i>. You should submit your different parts of  work into the exactly right folders. Illegal submission makes trouble.</p>
    <p>Please <strong>don't</strong> compress your submission, both reports and codes, into a single file, just submit the whole folder.  Your submission's folder should be named after your student ID. e.g. SA11011011, to indicate the submission's author.</p>
    <p>Note that you can submit your works only once.</p>
    <!--<p>Last but not least, in addition to submitting your whole work as a folder to the corresponding place, you should resubmit your source code(only source code), <strong>not</strong> compressed either, into the folder 'code' in the root directory. Note that the codes should be filed into one folder named after your id number too.  The name of the subdirectory indicates the corresponding language you are using. Just submit your code into the corresponding language subdirectory.  Be careful so as to submit your code into the right place.
    </p>-->
